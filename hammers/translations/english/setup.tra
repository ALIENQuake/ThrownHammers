@3 = ~Meraera's Dagger +2~
@4 = ~Dagger of Returning +2: "Meraera's Dagger"
An elven scholar-mage of the Olin Gisiae ("secret keepers") enchanted this dagger. She bound it with the essense of a minor demon and charged it to return to its thrower. Arcane runes wind around the hilt, but whatever meaning they possess is a well-guarded secret, like so much of Olin Gisir lore.

@7 = ~Essembra Hammer +2~
@8 = ~The Essembra Hammer is named for its place of invention in the Dalelands. This polearm consists of a hammerhead with a spike at its rear, mounted on a long pole reaching practically ten feet in length. A long spear-like top-spike allows the wielder to keep enemies at bay and switch tactics to a deadly thrust attack. It is one of the heavier pole weapons and is rather slow. The entire weapon is made of steel, including the pole, and is decorated with carvings and precious metal gilding. This particular Essembra hammer bears a potent enchantment that can strike an enemy down or cause him to flee in abject horror.

@15 = ~War Hammer +3: "Dwarven Thrower"
This hammer - not to be confused with the elven-made Dwarf Thrower - is only usable by dwarves. In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior or priest, the hammer may be thrown at an opponent. The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder. If it hits an opponent, it does double the damage that a thrown hammer would normally do. Against giants and ogres, the hammer does an additional +8 damage due to the special hatred dwarves hold for these races.
