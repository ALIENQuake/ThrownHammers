The only thing changed is a copy (only items descriptions) of setup.tra named setup-EE.tra. This file should be adopted to use EE engine item description formatting that differs from the one in the vanilla engine. Before you start the work please check the BG:EE or BG2:EE TLK files to see how the descriptions are formatted in your language. Some of these strings already exists in game.
