The only thing changed for the non-English languages is a copy (only items descriptions) of setup.tra named setup-EE.tra. This file should be adopted to use EE engine item description formatting that differs from the one in the vanilla engine. Before you start the work please check the BG:EE or BG2:EE TLK files to see how the descriptions are formatted in your language. Some of these strings already exists in game.

I (Sam.) have modified the English setup.tra and setup-EE.tra files to add as much consistency as possible across EE and non-EE games, and to minimize the effort required to translate two different versions of the same information.  Feel free to use this as a template rather than restructuring the existing translated descriptions yourself.  The English version of the TRAs also now contain more/corrected information compared to the strings shipped in the previous version (v4.1 fom September 15, 2014).
